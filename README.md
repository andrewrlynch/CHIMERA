# StochasticCINSelectionModel
Population-level karyptypic variation is dependent on 4 factors:<br>
1. Chromosome missegregation rate<br>
2. Positive or negative selection on aneuploid cells<br>
3. The number of cellular divisions that occur<br>
4. The periodicity of chromosomal instability (i.e. how *often* it occurs)<br>

These documents will serve as version control for the stochastic models of these factors with selection based on normalized gene numbers from each chromosome. All models were developed in NetLogo. 

*CINModelMaster.nlogo3d* is the fundamental framework on which all other files in the ModelingScripts folder are built on.
